MVP admission workflow (simplified)

Goal: Allow applicants to apply for admission, let admin approve/reject, and turn approved applicants into student accounts.

1. Applicant account creation (MVP)
POS 1: Applicant can register with a unique email and valid data.
POS 2: System creates a User with role "applicant" and returns a simple success message (email sending is optional for MVP).
POS 3: Applicant uses the same email/password to log in and continue the admission process.

2. Filling application form (MVP)
POS 1: Logged-in applicant can access an admission form.
POS 2: Form collects personal details and program selection (e.g., BSc CSIT, BCA, etc.).
POS 3: When applicant clicks "Final Submit", the application is marked as submitted and no longer editable.

3. Admin review & decision (MVP)
POS 1: Admin can fetch a list of submitted applications via an admin-only API.
POS 2: Admin can approve or reject an application using simple endpoints.
POS 3: On approve, system upgrades/creates a User with role "student" and generates a registration number and temporary password (which acts as main password in MVP).

4. Status tracking for applicant (MVP)
POS 1: Logged-in applicant can see their current application status (e.g., "under_review", "accepted", "rejected").
POS 2: Applicant sees their Application ID / reference number after final submit.
POS 3: When status changes to "accepted", the UI shows that portal credentials have been created and where to use them (student portal login).
